# ShadowKeeperDemo
Hi! I'm just starting out with game development, and this is one of my very first projects. I made this game as part of my high school graduation exam, and I'm uploading it here to get some feedback and learn how to improve.
Please keep in mind that it's a beginner project — the option button doesn't work and there’s no tutorial yet, so below are the controls you’ll need to play.

Keyboard Controls

Attack: Left Mouse Button

Use Quick Item: Right Mouse Button

Inventory: I

Equip Quick Items: Double Left Click on item in inventory

PS5 Controller

Attack: R1

Dash: Circle

Use Quick Item: Square

Inventory: Touchpad

Equip Quick Items: Press X twice on the item

Xbox Controller

Attack: RB

Dash: B

Use Quick Item: X

Inventory: View Button (the small button with two squares)

Equip Quick Items: Press A twice on the item

Thanks a lot for checking out my project — any feedback is really appreciated!
